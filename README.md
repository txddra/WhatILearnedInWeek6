a lot  of information to take in this go around, so here's me trying to keep up :

- **For loops**
  
  ## __Arrays__
**Arrays** in JavaScript are a way to store elements in a single variable in memory 
- Arrays:

    - Are ordered
    - Have indices starting at 0
    - Can contain duplicate elements

- Declaring an array:

`let myBox = [];   // Initial Array declaration in JS`

- Arrays can contain multiple data types

`let myBox = ['hello', 1, 2, 3, true, 'hi'];`



## __While Loops__



## __For Loops__

**The for loop** runs a block of code as many times as you want to. Here’s a for loop that runs bounceBall ten times:

`for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {   bounceBall() }`

It’s broken down into four parts — the **initialExpression**, the **condition**, the **incrementalExpression** , and the **statement**:
