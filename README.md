a lot  of information to take in this go around, so here's me trying to keep up : 
- **Arrays**
- **While loops**
- **For loops**
  
  ## [__Arrays__](https://javascript.info/array)
**Arrays** in JavaScript are a way to store elements in a single variable in memory 
- Arrays:

    - Are ordered
    - Have indices starting at 0
    - Can contain duplicate elements

- Declaring an array:

`let myBox = [];   // Initial Array declaration in JS`

- Arrays can contain multiple data types

`let myBox = ['hello', 1, 2, 3, true, 'hi'];`
- Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.

We can get an element by its number in square brackets:

`let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert( fruits[0] ); // Apple
alert( fruits[1] ); // Orange
alert( fruits[2] ); /
`


## [__While Loops__](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-loops-explained-for-loop-for/)
The while loop starts by evaluating the condition. If the condition is true, the statement(s) is/are executed. If the condition is false, the statement(s) is/are not executed. After that, while loop ends.

Here is the syntax for while loop:
Syntax:

`while (condition)

{

  statement(s);

}`



## [__For Loops__](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-essentials-how-to-wrap-your-head-around-for-loops-64e1a7248c9e/)

**The for loop** runs a block of code as many times as you want to. Here’s a for loop that runs bounceBall ten times:

`for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {   bounceBall() }`

It’s broken down into four parts — the **initialExpression**, the **condition**, the **incrementalExpression** , and the **statement**:

`for (initialExpression; condition; incrementExpression) {   statement }`
