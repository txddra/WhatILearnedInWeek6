a lot  of information to take in this go around, so here's me trying to keep up : 
- **Arrays**
- **While loops**
- **For loops**
  
  ## __Arrays__
**Arrays** in JavaScript are a way to store elements in a single variable in memory 
- Arrays:

    - Are ordered
    - Have indices starting at 0
    - Can contain duplicate elements
